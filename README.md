- 👋 Hi, I’m @lcdnbl
- 👀 I’m interested in GitHub markdown emoji :sunglasses: (due to this about me template obviously) :metal: :v: :godmode: :hurtrealbad:
- 🌱 I’m currently learning where I left off some random project months or years ago
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on...  nothing in particular. :penguin: :floppy_disk: :computer: It would be cool to contribute to program design, be it algorithm, data structure, control flow, etc.
- 📫 How to reach me...  tough one.  let's assume I'm still alive (which will obviously be false much longer than it will be true).  maybe after some months or years I would see your notes in a pull request?

I gotta keep the instructional note below because my memory is not reliable.
